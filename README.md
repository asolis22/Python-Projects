These is a branch for the python personal projects that I have done. Below will be a
description of each project uploaded.

text_translation.py - This python script utilizes the Natural language tookit (NLTK) to 
                      implement a Naive Bayes Classifier for detecting languages based on
                      a small dataset of words in English and Spanish. It begins by defining
                      a datset that pairs words with their respective langages, then extracts 
                      features from each word by creating a dictinoary that indicated the 
                      the presence of characters. After training the classifier on these 
                      features, it predicts the language of a list of text words, printing 
                      each word alongside its predicted languages.
