These is a branch for the python personal projects that I have done. Below will be a
description of each project uploaded.

text_translation.py - This python script utilizes the Natural language tookit (NLTK) to 
                      implement a Naive Bayes Classifier for detecting languages based on
                      a small dataset of words in English and Spanish. It begins by defining
                      a datset that pairs words with their respective langages, then extracts 
                      features from each word by creating a dictinoary that indicated the 
                      the presence of characters. After training the classifier on these 
                      features, it predicts the language of a list of text words, printing 
                      each word alongside its predicted languages. 

Egyption.py - Created a simulation of the game SlapJack. It utilizing a standard 52-card               deck (excluding Jokers). The game rules are straightfoward: players must                 slap the card when a Jack is played, when two of the same card appear                    (doubles), or when a Queen and King are played together (marriage). The                  program begins by explaining the game rules and then sets up the deck,                   shuffling it and dividing it among four players: the human player and                    three AI opponents. Each player's turn involves playing a card and                      checking for slap opportunities. The game continues until one player                     collects all the cards, declaring them the winner. The project also                      incorporates timed input for slapping, making it a fast-paced and engaging                experience.
